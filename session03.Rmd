# Does globalization only happen as of now?

--

## Hardwired theory

Nayan Chandra<sup>.red[1]</sup> claims globalization stems from a: .orange[basic human urge to seek a better and more fulfilling life].

--

Can be traced back to first movements of human species, part of early human history.

--

Has included activities of: trade, missionary work, adventures, and conquests.

--

Therefore globalization is nothing new.

## This view has been supported by empirical evidence

## Some scholar pushes this date even further: Exchange of information is a fundamental element at the life's origin

## Cycle theory

Globalization is a long-term cyclical process.

--

Understanding the cycles rather than a single point of origin is most important.

--

Therefore again globalization is nothing new.

--

The current "global age" will pass and eventually be replaced by a new globalization.

--

## Events theory

It is possible to point to specific events as the origin of globalization.

--

Many can be identified – some are events that took place over time, others are exact days, such as:

-  Roman conquests
-  "Discovery" of America (by who? Columbus? Native Americans?)
-  The first transatlantic telephone cable (1956)
-  Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001

---

## Phases theory

Several great phases or waves of globalization are identified, each with their own point of origin.

--

These phases happened sequentially, building on each other, and so this is different to the cycles theory.

--

.orange[Human migration history]

- The prehistoric period (10000 BC - 3500 BC)
- The premodern period (3500 BC - 1500 AD)
- Early modern period (1500 - 1750)
- The modern period (1750 - 1980s)
- The contemporary period (1980s - current)

---

### The Prehistoric period: the Great Divergence
Human being emerged slowly from a .green[single origin] (East Africa) but gradually moving and diversifying all over the world.

--

Globalization was very limited due to .green[lack of advanced technology] to overcome existing geographical and social obstacles. Long-distance interactions never materialized. 

--

Very limited social-political structures: from hunters and gathers to settlers and farmers. Human first learn producing their own food. Surplus of food create new social classes (craftsman, bureaucrats, soldiers).

--

### The premodern period

New technology: .green[writing] (Mesopotamia 美索不達米亞, Egypt, and central China) and .green[wheels] (Southwest Asia).

--

Wheels allows faster and more distant travel. Writing allows the spread of ideas and inventions. Writing also facilitated the coordination of complex social activities and thus encouraged large state formations.

---

### At late stage of premodern period

.green[Empires] emerged, resulting vast territorial accumulations:

- Egyptian Kingdoms
- Persian Empires
- Macedonian Empires
- American Empires of Aztec and the Incas
- Roman Empire
- Indian Empire
- Byzantine Empire
- Islamic Caliphates
- Holy Roman Empires
- African Empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay
- Ottoman Empire
- Chinese Empire (most enduring and technological advanced)

---

### Global trade started at this stage

]

---

### Global trade expands the economic and cultural exchange

--

Large scale migration becomes possible. 

--

Urban cities emerged.

--

Major religions emerged (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism)

--

Downside: more human interaction, more infectious disease such as plague. The enormous plague of the mid-14 century killed up to one-third of the population of China, the Middle East, and Europe. 

---

### Modern Human migration: A visualization

We now have the technology to show in great detail how human move from place to place. In this video, pay special attention to Paris, as the cultural, political, economic, and education center of the Europe in 18th century:

## When should we count globalization? 

--

Some would prefer to capture its contemporary uniqueness: .orange[post-1989].
  
--

Some would prefer to include the start of .orange[industrial revolution].
   
--

Some argues that globalization is a continuation and extension of complex process that begin with the emergence of modernity (現代性) in .orange[the 1500s].
  
--

Still others argue that globalization should not be measured in mere decades or centuries. Rather, they suggest these processes have been folding for .orange[millennial].

## Has Xuanzang's journey changed China?

--

China discovered that it is not the only civilization.

--

Through (mis)translation: the Chinese began to believe that a soul that was as an imperishable part of one's humanity.

--

Xuanzang's journey embodied a systematic approach to localize Buddhism in China.

--

- Buddhism first arrived China in Han Dynasty (206BC - 220 AD).
- Through generations of Chinese monks' work, Buddhism interacts with Daoism which produced the Zen school, a truly "Chinese" version of Buddhism.

## An openness toward all schools of thoughts

.pull-left[
貞觀十有二年秋七月，詔曰︰「道無常名，聖無常體，隨方設教，密濟群生。詳其教旨，玄妙無為，觀其元宗，生成立要。詞無繁說，理有忘筌，濟物利人，宜行天下。」
]

.pull-right[
.cyan[_Translation_:] The way for humanity, at different times, different places, did not have the same name. And the great Sage, at different times and different places, was not the same human body. Over history, heaven ordained that true religion, would be established in different countries and different climates so that all the humanity can be saved. And we've considered the Christian scriptures and have decided that, in all their essentials, they are about the core values of humanity, and we have decreed that they be propagated throughout the Empire.

## Education through human interaction at times with limited technology

--

To be changed by the experience by others.

--

- Openness

--

- Curiosity

--

- Perseverance 

--

Some times it is not irreversible.
